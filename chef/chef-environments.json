  -  create chef-repo/environments/dev.json

  {
      "name": "dev",
      "json_class": "Chef::Environment",
      "description": "development environment",
      "cookbook_versions": {
        "couchdb": "= 11.0.0"
      },
      "chef_type": "environment",
      "default_attributes": {
          "apache2": {
          "listen_ports": [
            "80",
            "443"
          ]
          }
      }
}
